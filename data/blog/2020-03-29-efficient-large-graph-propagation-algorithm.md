Cross-posting from my company's blog, but if you have not checked it out, I wrote an [interesting technical piece on how we engineered a large scale label propagation algorithm](https://www.cylynx.io/blog/efficient-large-graph-label-propagation-algorithm).

The accompanying slides can be found [here](https://www.timlrx.com/large-graph-analytics/index.html)
